## Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This project uses 3D CNNs to analyze volumetric data from medical scans, enabling accurate and early diagnosis of lung diseases.

## Features
- **3D CNN Architecture**: Utilizes advanced 3D CNNs for volumetric data analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for preprocessing medical images.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive training pipeline with performance metrics.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing model predictions and learned features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the model.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations.
- **Scipy**: Used for scientific and technical computing.

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset of lung CT scans. Ensure you have the proper permissions to use the dataset.

- **[Dataset Source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20100362v1)**
  
Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.
